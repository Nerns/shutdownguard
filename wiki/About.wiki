The idea for ShutdownGuard came from a program I made a long time ago in Delphi, named ShutdownGuard. This C-port is a much improved version of that. You can download the old Delphi program and its source from the [http://code.google.com/p/shutdownguard/downloads/list downloads section].

Note that programs are still able to shutdown Windows if they explicitly force it.

With Vista, Microsoft broke all programs who previously prevented shutdowns, now programs have to specify a reason as to why they want to prevent a shutdown.
