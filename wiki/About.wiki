The idea for ShutdownGuard came from a program I made a long time ago in Delphi, named ShutdownGuard. This C-port is a much improved version of that. You can download the old Delphi program and its source from the [http://code.google.com/p/shutdownguard/downloads/list Downloads section].

Note that programs are still able to shutdown Windows if they explicitly force it. You might be able to block these programs by using [PatchApps], but beware that it is an experimental feature.

= Balloon tips =

Initially I had some troubles getting the balloon tips to work properly. I got some help from [http://vbnet.mvps.org/index.html?code/subclass/shellnotifyballoontipclick.htm this page]. I'm very pleased with the result.

= Vista =

With Vista, Microsoft broke all programs who previously prevented shutdowns, now programs have to specify a reason as to why they want to prevent a shutdown.

This dialog is created by Vista, not ShutdownGuard.

= Privileges =

Applications must get the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa392758(VS.85).aspx SeShutdownPrivilege] to shutdown Windows. [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376861(VS.85).aspx This msdn page] contains some good example code on how to obtain it. Note: This is only interesting to developers.

= Limited User =

I've tried running ShutdownGuard as a limited user and in my tests it was able to prevent shutdowns, reboots, and log offs as usual. It couldn't initiate a shutdown but was able to log out.
